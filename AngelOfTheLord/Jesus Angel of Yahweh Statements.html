	<strong>
		An Important Principle and Observation
	</strong>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Does God change as shifting shadows?
	</li>
	<li>
		Does he change his plans and purposes?
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	The answer to this question is of course, NO [Num 23:19; 1Sa 15:29; Mic 7:20; Hab 2:3; Mal 3:6; Luk 21:33; Rom 11:29; Tit 1:2; Heb 6:18; Jas 1:17].
</p>
<p>
	This is a most important truth about God and His ways&mdash;God does not change.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		When God created man, he stated that he wanted man to have the dominion. Things went wrong. Men proved to be undeserving of such honor. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s plan and purpose for man never changed. What has become abundantly clear, especially under the New Covenant, is that God is still going through with His plan for man. This is just one sample of God never changing His plan.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We should take every word of God seriously. If God reveals a plan to us, then we should never without very clear revelation treat the plan like it has changed. Let us apply this, not only to men, but the Angel of Yahweh.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		The Angel of Yahweh and God&rsquo;s Consistency
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Whatever God has said about the Angel of Yahweh, whatever attribute God has said or revealed He has given to him, whatever purpose God has said or revealed that He has ordained for him to fulfill, we must be careful not to deny the Angel of it or/and transfer it to someone else.
</p>
<p>
	If God has said that the Angel of Yahweh will do a thing, then he is the one who will do it.
</p>
<p>
	If that thing is being done, then it is the Angel of Yahweh who is doing it.
</p>
<p>
	If the thing has been done, then it is the Angel of Yahweh who has done it.
</p>
<p>
	If the Angel of Yahweh does not do it, then it means that he failed which would mean that God made a mistake about this Angel since he wasn&rsquo;t able to do what God said he would do.
</p>
<p>
	If God transferred a purpose meant for the Angel to someone else, even though the Angel did not fail in his assignment, then it means that God has changed his mind about the Angel. But why would God change his mind about the Angel? The only reason why God would do that is that the angel sins against God and proves to be unfaithful. In any case, God would be proven to have made a mistake about the Angel of Yahweh which is absurd.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		When God said that Moses was to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, Moses did. Yes, Moses did not take them in, but that was never once stated as a purpose for Moses [Exo 3:7-10].
	</li>
	<li>
		Samson, like all men sinned, but his sin did not stop the stated purpose of God from being accomplished. When God said that Samson would begin the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines [Jdg 13:5], that was exactly what Samson did. Yes, he was so powerful and could even have finished it. No matter. He still accomplished the stated purpose for his birth&mdash;begin the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines.
	</li>
	<li>
		Although Elijah said he was tired [1Ki 19:4], nevertheless, the work he was meant to do which is to turn the hearts of Israel back to God [1Ki 18:37ff cf., Luk 1:16-17], he will still come back to finish [Mal 4:5-6].
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	If God says that he has given this Angel certain attributes, then except he tells us that he gave someone else, then if ever we find anyone with these attributes, especially when they are all complete in him, it is no other but the only one God told us has these attributes.

		<strong>
			The Name You have given me

			&ldquo;

		<strong>
			I am the good shepherd&rdquo; [

		</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Jacob, in blessing Ephraim and Manasseh, refers to the Angel whom he called &ldquo;Peniel&rdquo;
				<em>
					(or the face of Yahweh)
				</em>
				 as &ldquo;the Shepherd who has delivered me from all harm&rdquo; [Gen 48:15-16
				<em>
					 cf.,
				</em>
				Gen 31:11-13; Gen 49:22-25].
			</li>
			<li>
				Isaiah calls the Angel of Yahweh&rsquo;s Presence the Shepherd of Israel [Isa 63:11,7-14]
			</li>
			<li>
				In reality, the office and role of &ldquo;
				<strong>
					Shepherd of Israel
				</strong>
				&rdquo; the same as &ldquo;
				<strong>
					Captain of the Hosts Yahweh
				</strong>
				&rdquo;
				<em>
					(i.e., Israel)
				</em>
				 [Jos 5:14-15,12-15]. Consider 2Sa 5:2.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>
			&ldquo;I will give you rest&rdquo; [
		</strong>
		<strong>
			Mat 11:28
		</strong>
		<strong>
			]
		</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Rest depends on walking in the ways of righteousness [Psa 94:13; Isa 48:17-18; Jer 6:16]
			</li>
			<li>
				The Presence of Yahweh was the One who was to give Israel rest [Exo 33:14; Isa 63:8-9,14]. This rest, as is clear from Scriptures
				<em>
					(see
				</em>
				<em>
					Heb 4:8
				</em>
				<em>
					ff)
				</em>
				 was not simply the earthly promised land of Canaan.
			</li>
			<li>
				Therefore, Jesus is either the &ldquo;Presence of Yahweh&rdquo; who was to give the people rest or he was replacing him in this assignment. Of course, if God says that it was going to be through that Angel, then with no express word from God saying that he has changed that arrangement, it is certainly that Angel that will do it.

	<li>
		<strong>
			&ldquo;&hellip;
		</strong>
		<strong>
			you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.
		</strong>
		<strong>
			&rdquo; [
		</strong>
		<strong>
			Joh 1:51
		</strong>
		<strong>
			]
		</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>
				This is a direct reference to the experience of Jacob at Bethel [Gen 28:12]. There, Yahweh, in the Person of the Angel of Yahweh&rsquo;s Presence, was at the head of the stairway with angels descending and ascending.
			</li>
			<li>
				Yahweh, the Stairway, and the Rock on which Jacob&rsquo;s head rested.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>
			&ldquo;I am the gate for the sheep&rdquo; [
		</strong>
		<strong>
			Joh 10:7
		</strong>
		<strong>
			,
		</strong>
		<strong>
			8
		</strong>
		<strong>

		</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>
				&ldquo;&hellip;this is the gate of heaven.&rdquo; [Gen 28:17]
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>
			The Anointed One
		</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The Angel of Yahweh who appeared to Jacob as he fled from his brother was the first person in Scriptures to be anointed. The Rock that Jacob anointed was representative of the Angel of Yahweh&mdash;Jacob was anointing Yahweh.
			</li>
			<li>
				It is interesting that Hanna, the mother of Samuel, spoke about Yahweh&rsquo;s Anointed as already existing before there was a king anointed in Israel [1Sa 2:10].
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>
			&ldquo;No one comes to the Father except by me&rdquo; [
		</strong>
		<strong>
			Joh 14:6
		</strong>
		<strong>
			]
		</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>
				What the records of the OT show is that no one has ever related directly with God. The only person that has manifested as God to men has been the Angel of Yahweh&rsquo;s Presence.
			</li>
			<li>
				Also, while other nations under other &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; were regarded as not God&rsquo;s people, the people of Israel who were under Yahweh or the Captain of Yahweh&rsquo;s Hosts were regarded as God&rsquo;s people. This implies that to be God&rsquo;s people, one must be under Yahweh the Captain of the Hosts.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>
			&ldquo;&hellip;In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.&rdquo; [
		</strong>
		<strong>
			Mat 26:64
		</strong>
		<strong>
			]
		</strong>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<strong>
		&ldquo;At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.&rdquo; [
	</strong>
	<strong>
		Luk 21:27
	</strong>
	<strong>
		]
	</strong>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Jesus will be coming
		<ol>
			<li>
				Seated at the Right Hand of the Mighty One
			</li>
			<li>
				In a Cloud
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>
		With power and great glory
	</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>
		Because of &ldquo;Son of Man&rdquo; and &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;, what often comes to mind when we hear these words is the vision of Daniel where he saw &ldquo;One Like A Son of Man&rdquo; coming with the clouds of heaven into the presence of the Ancient of Days. However, what describes here actually better fits the vision of Ezekiel by the Kebar River. This vision of Ezekiel had
		<ol>
			<li>
				One, whom Ezekiel described as &ldquo;the Likeness of the Glory of God&rdquo;, and so on, but also, more significantly, as &ldquo;a figure like that of a man&rdquo; [Eze 1:26]. This is really no different from Daniel&rsquo;s description of &ldquo;one like a son of man&rdquo;. The point is that the one they were seeing looked like a man but wasn&rsquo;t really a man.
			</li>
			<li>
				This person was seated on a Throne [Eze 1:26]. Now, since this person was not really God himself but his glory, and since he was clearly seated on God&rsquo;s Throne, it means that, like Joseph, he was acting as Yahweh God&rsquo;s right hand. If we may recollect, Pharaoh gave Joseph his second chariot to ride in [Gen 41:43] and, from the mobile Ark of Yahweh and the visions of the prophets, the Throne of God is a Chariot Throne, a Mobile Throne.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>
		This person seated on Yahweh&rsquo;s Throne came in the immense cloud
	</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>
		And was evidently coming with great power and glory.
	</li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>
			&ldquo;Listen to him.&rdquo; [
		</strong>
		<strong>
			Mat 17:5
		</strong>
		<strong>
			]
		</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>
				God also commanded the Israelites to listen to the angel he was sending with them [Exo 23:20,22]
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>
			&ldquo;You have the words of eternal life&rdquo; [
		</strong>
		<strong>
			Joh 6:68
		</strong>
		<strong>
			]
		</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The Israelites were to live by every word from the mouth of God. But where would they get these words?
			</li>
			<li>
				God was present with the Israelites in the wilderness through the Angel that was sent with them&mdash;the Angel that was called God and Yahweh. God commanded the Israelites to listen to this Angel and if they did, they would be listening to Him [Exo 23:20-23
				<em>
					ff
				</em>
				]. Blessings were conditioned on listening to the Angel.
			</li>
			<li>
				Therefore, when Moses says that they were to live by every word of God, since God to them was the Angel, they were to live by every word of the Angel. So, the words of the Angel are the words of eternal life.
			</li>
			<li>
				In fact, Stephen plainly confirms this when he says that Moses received &ldquo;living words&rdquo; from &ldquo;the angel that spoke to him on the mountain&rdquo; [Act 7:38]
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>
			The Word of God
		</strong>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The words that Jesus speaks are the Word of God [Exo 23:22,20-23]
			</li>
			<li>
				The Angel of Yahweh is called &ldquo;the Word of Yahweh&rdquo; [Gen 15:1; 1Sa 3:21]
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		&ldquo;You have the words of eternal life&rdquo; [Joh 6:68-69]
		<ol>
			<li>
				The Angel of Yahweh had &ldquo;living words&rdquo; [Act 7:38]
			</li>
			<li>
				The word of God gives eternal life [Deu 8:3]. However, it was the Angel of Yahweh who was in the wilderness with the Moses and the Israelites and it was from him that they heard the words of God [Exo 23:22,20-23; Act 7:38]
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		&ldquo;The Book of Life belonging to the Lamb&rdquo; [Rev 13:18; 17:18
		<em>
			cf.,
		</em>
		Exo 32:32]
